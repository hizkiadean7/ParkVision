# ParkVision

This is an Artificial Intelligence project where we trained a model and applied it to a real-world use case. Our team explored its potential in the medical field, testing the capability of one model. This led to the creation of ParkVision (Parkinson Vision).

ParkVision is a web-based platform that allows users to upload hand-drawn spiral or wave patterns. The uploaded image is then analyzed by an AI model using machine learning (image processing) to detect potential Parkinson’s tremors or classify it as normal.

# Requirements
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

Install Python ~ Recommended version: 3.8–3.9 (best compatibility with TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, and Matplotlib). ~ Supported versions: 3.7–3.10.

Open the project in an IDE (recommended: Visual Studio Code).

Install required libraries by running these commands in your terminal: py -m pip install tensorflow py -m pip install keras py -m pip install matplotlib py -m pip install flask ⚠️ Use py -m pip install to avoid installation issues. Make sure pip is configured properly.

Run the project ~ Open the app.py file. ~ Run it in the terminal. ~ You’ll see a server link like http://127.0.0.1:5000/. ~ Open it in your browser (or Ctrl + Click the link) to launch the Flask application.
